    \noindent Production Planning and Scheduling are important phases of the productive process in a manufacturing system. To ensure that the production planning and scheduling of a production system be satisfactory it is necessary the forecast of the capacity as accurate as possible. And to ensure this accuracy, it is necessary the utilization of rules of forecast such as the rules of Clearing Function, which is a function that estimates the capacity when the problem is modeled by queuing theory, and/or the Lot Streaming techniques, which is a scheduling technique that divides a production lot into smaller sublots to be processed in overlapping. Production planning and scheduling are generally executed in separated phases, what generates a delay on the changing information between the operations on these levels. Linking these phases means to create a virtuous cycle between planning and scheduling, once the forecasts of capacity of the Clearing Function, on planning phase, are sent to scheduling phase that updates the Lot Streaming, which in turn returns the feedback to planning. This research will study the problem of linking the Production Planning with Scheduling by coupling the forecasts of capacity given by the rules of Clearing Function and those given by Lot Streaming techniques.
