@phdthesis{CONTE2016,
abstract = {The objective of this work is to develop a mathematical model to represent the con- cept of clearing function (CF), which regulates the throughput rate in a production system as a function of the system's workload. A new approach to Little's law is used, suggesting that a system's throughput rate depends on two variables: system load and cycle time. The clearing function concept allows throughput rates to be defined in order to feed the linear programming models involved in mathematical modelling of the production systems. The main approach used to achieve these goals has been to combine linear programming models with the concept of clearing func- tion. Nevertheless, at least as of this writing the results have not been as remarkable as expected. This present study argues that a major reason for these disappointing results is the way previous approaches have considered the clearing function. The assumption that system loading is the only argument for clearing function is not sufficient to obtain a model that can provide all the needed information about th- roughput rates and cycle times in the system. One of the issues discussed is whether a clearing function which depends on two variables (system load and cycle time) is a powerful model for representing this throughput rate; in other words, the goal here is how to efficiently model the clearing function as a function of two variables, and to compare this new approach with the approach to clearing function that depends on system loading, which has hitherto been used in the literature. The experimental design consisted of generating values for the response variable X (throughput rate) as a function of two other variables, a fixedW (work in process) and another random TC (cycle time in the system). The dynamic regression model for CF emerged from the implementation of the new methodology, which initially involved analyzing the normality of the residuals obtained from adjusting the set of non-linear regression models and then adjusting the temporal series in the residuals which had rejected the normality hypothesis. In the first stage, we used the Monte Carlo simulation with 500 repetitions to collect data and to estimate and evaluate normality. At this stage, the two-variable model yielded a higher number of repetitions with normal distribution for the residuals than the functional model used in the literature. In the second stage, parameters were estimated using time series for the abnormal residues and the white noise was analyzed. Both models adjusted to the residuals for the time series were successful in all repetitions.},

abstract = {Models and optimisation approaches are developed for a flexible job shop scheduling problem with lot streaming and lot sizing of the variable sublots.Atwo-stage optimisation procedure is proposed. First, the makespan value is minimised with the smallest sublots defined for the problem instance. This makes it possible to shorten the makespan significantly, because each sublot is transferred separately to the next operation of a job. In the second stage, the sizes of the sublots are maximised without increasing the obtainedmakespan value. In this way, the quantity of sublots and transport activities is limited together with the related manufacturing cost. Two objectives are defined for the second stage. The first one is themaximisation of the sum of the sublot sizes of all operations, the second one is the maximisation of the number of the operations which do not need to be split at all. Mixed-integer linear programming, constraint programming and graph-based models are implemented for the problem. Two optimisation approaches are developed and compared in computational experiments for each stage and objective, one approach is based on a third-party solver, and the second one on an independent own implementation, namely a tabu search and a greedy constructive heuristic.

abstract = {The clearing function models the non-linear relationship between WIP and throughput and has been proposed for production planning in environments with queuing (congestion) effects. However, incorporating clearing function concept in multi-product manufacturing networks is challenging. The traditional approach has been to model the clearing function at the bottleneck machine only. However, since the bottleneck shifts as the product release mix changes, this approach has its limitations. In this paper, the weakness of the bottleneck approach is highlighted using the mean-value analysis for the closed queuing network case.},

abstract = {In this paper, a discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm is proposed to solve the lot-streaming flow shop scheduling problem with the criterion of total weighted earliness and tardiness penalties under both the idling and no-idling cases. Unlike the original {\{}ABC{\}} algorithm, the proposed {\{}DABC{\}} algorithm represents a food source as a discrete job permutation and applies discrete operators to generate new neighboring food sources for the employed bees, onlookers and scouts. An efficient initialization scheme, which is based on the earliest due date (EDD), the smallest slack time on the last machine (LSL) and the smallest overall slack time (OSL) rules, is presented to construct the initial population with certain quality and diversity. In addition, a self adaptive strategy for generating neighboring food sources based on insert and swap operators is developed to enable the {\{}DABC{\}} algorithm to work on discrete/combinatorial spaces. Furthermore, a simple but effective local search approach is embedded in the proposed {\{}DABC{\}} algorithm to enhance the local intensification capability. Through the analysis of experimental results, the highly effective performance of the proposed {\{}DABC{\}} algorithm is shown against the best performing algorithms from the literature.},

abstract = {Previous studies of production planning have indicated that capacity affects production costs, and that the existing schemes of decomposition do not work well in these circumstances. The coupling of mathematical programming and clearing function to obtain good practical solutions for production planning problems at the same time that improve the model quality, introduce constraints of capacity, thus, creating a kind of paradox: improves the production planning model, but becomes ineffective the process of solution for the model. This paper provides a new scheme to decompose the problem of production planning coupled with clearing function, which circumvents the drawback related to the classical approach, which always works well under mild assumptions. Numerical illustration will be provided to indicate where the classical approach fails, and how the new scheme accomplishes properly the task.},

abstract = {We will develop a mathematical model for the integration of lot sizing and flow shop scheduling with lot streaming. We will develop a mixed-integer linear model for multiple products lot sizing and lot streaming problems. Mixed-integer programming formulation is presented which will enable the user to find optimal production quantities, optimal inventory levels, optimal sublot sizes, and optimal sequence simultaneously. We will use numerical example to show practicality of the proposed model. We test eight different lot streaming problems: (1) consistent sublots with intermingling, (2) consistent sublots and no intermingling between sublots of the products (without intermingling), (3) equal sublots with intermingling, (4) equal sublots without intermingling, (5) no-wait consistent sublots with intermingling, (6) no-wait equal sublots with intermingling, (7) no-wait consistent sublots without intermingling, and (8) no-wait equal sublots without intermingling. We showed that the best makespan can be achieved through the consistent sublots with intermingling case.},

@article{Missbauer2011,
abstract = {We consider the problem of planning future order releases in hierarchical production planning and control systems. An established research direction is the clearing function concept: the planned material flow through a production unit is modelled by inventory balance equations for WIP and final products, and the consequences of the stochastic properties of the material flow are modelled by clearing functions, which is the functional relationship between the level of WIP and the maximum output of a work centre in a period. Using a transient M/M/1 model, our paper shows that the usual definition of a nonlinear clearing function suffers from substantial shortcomings concerning both the definition of the function and empirical estimation of its parameters. We propose an alternative transient clearing function and derive a procedure for its parameterization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Due to heavy transportation for single-setup multidelivery (SSMD) policy in supply chain management, this model assumes carbon emission cost to obtain a realistic behavior for world environment. The transportation for buyer and vendor is considered along with setup cost reduction by using an investment function. It is assumed that the shipment lot size of each delivery is unequal and variable. The buyer inspects all received products and returns defective items to vendor for reworking process. Because of this policy, end customers will only obtain nondefective items. The analytical optimization is considered to obtain the optimum solution of the model. The main goal of this paper is to reduce the total cost by considering carbon emission during the transportation. A numerical example, graphical representation, and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the model.},
